Simplest ReactiveUI Blazor App Ever!
====================================

Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
-------------

Welcome to my little sandbox where I play around with ReactiveUI and Blazor. It's not much, but it's honest work.

What's This All About?
----------------------

-   Reactive Commands: These nifty little commands respond to your every click, making the UI interactive and lively.
-   UI Updates on the Fly: Watch as the UI updates in real-time, all thanks to the magic of ReactiveUI.
-   Engage with the UI: A simple text box and button are all it takes to demonstrate the dynamic capabilities of ReactiveUI.

Ready, Set, Go!
---------------

### Before You Start

-   You'll need .NET 6.0 or newer.
-   Visual Studio or VSCode should be your trusty sidekicks.

### Running the App

1.  Grab the code:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReactiveUITest.git`

2.  Fire up your code editor and open the project.
3.  Hit build and run, and watch the app come to life.

How to Use It
-------------

-   You've got a text box to input whatever crosses your mind.
-   Hit the button and see how your text triggers a response in the app.

Dive Into the Code
------------------

### TestViewModel

-   The brains behind the operation, managing the UI's reactions and interactions.
-   Employs `ReactiveCommand` for handling user actions.

### TestService

-   Acts as the messenger, informing the app of any data changes.
-   Utilizes Reactive Extensions to keep everyone in the loop.

### Blazor Page (rxui)

-   The stage where all the action happens.
-   Seamlessly connected to `TestViewModel` for that smooth reactive experience.
